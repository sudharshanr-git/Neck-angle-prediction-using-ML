This project aims to prove that Machine learning models can be trained and used to predict the neck turn angle by, taking video from camera of any computing device as input.
Python files in Degree calculation algorithm are used to create training data. Those algorithms use simple logic to measure degree approximately.
Degree regression model contains ML algorithms' implementation and their promising results.
